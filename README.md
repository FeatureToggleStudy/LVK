# README

These projects create some nuget packages that form the backbone of my own applications. They are not
intended for public use, however you are free to do so.

Be aware that versioning does not follow semantic versioning, and that all the nuget packages produced
by these projects are "together" in the sense that version ranges are not considered. If you upgrade/use
one of them, you *probably* need to upgrade them all. As I said, they're not intended for anyone but me.
